Bubble Sort

How do you know?: TODO
I am deciding which sort is in use based on efficiency aka "time".
since, "at the end of this weeks lecture" we had a side by side comparison of how long it took for our sorts to work.
I can cross reference the speed of the 3 sorts to determine which one is is the correct sort.

Bubble sort is the slowest form of sorting. Sort 1 was the slowest of the 3 therefore sort 1 must be a bubble sort

sort2 uses: TODO
Merge sort.

How do you know?: TODO
how do I know that merge sort is used for 2?
sort 2 was the fastest and I know merge sort is the fastests of the 3 sorting algorithms

sort3 uses: TODO
Selection sort

How do you know?: TODO
Selection sort, "in terms of speed" is average when compared to the other 2 sorting methods.
sort 3 had an average speed therefore it should be a selection sort
