Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO

10 simulations proved to be incorrect. The more simulations provided, the more data is recieved and so more simulations equals more accuracy.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO

I would run 10000 simulations. accouring to my results, right after 10000 simulations is when the running time starts to increase. also, 10000
is a rather large number and should give us a rather accurate metric comparatively
